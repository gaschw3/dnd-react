## D&D React App
More or less a test/personal site that I use to play/run D&D 5e. It is mostly up to date with current play material but small changes/additions/subtractions have been made throughout based mostly on my whims.

[Go to site](https://gaschw3.github.io/dnd-react/#/)

## To-Do
* Convert HB monsters over into Beastiary.
* Potentially make changes to filtering interface, especially for spells.
* Character and Info pages in the campaign section to use for tracking.
  * Potential flavor stuff about planes, dieties, countries, etc. 
  * Ongoing tracker for various NPCs, places, and things in current game
  * Potentially a generator or something for stats, backgrounds, and names for NPCs

## Running Locally
Ostensibly you could run this locally if you have npm and node installed (I don't really have steps for that process). Just pull from this repo and then in the same directory as package.json run:

`npm update`

`npm start`

Pages should be served up at `http://localhost:3000/dnd-react/#/`
