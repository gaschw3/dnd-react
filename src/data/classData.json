When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The shot flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the shot to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d8 piercing damage, and you learn the target's current location.

Your reach increases by 5 feet for that attack, and it deals fire damage instead of bludgeoning damage.

If the attack hits you can spend 1 ki point to force the target to make a Strength saving throw or be pushed back 10 feet and be knocked prone. </p><h5>Rumbling Badger</h5><p class='pad-left'>You shake the ground, causing a tremor that knocks over your foes. You can spend 1 ki point to cast earth tremor. </p> <h5>Rush of the Gale Spirits</h5><p class='pad-left'>You send a blast of air outward with a thrust of your open palm. You can spend 2 ki points to cast gust of wind.</p><h5>Shape the Raincloud</h5><p class='pad-left'>You can spend 1 ki point to cast create or destroy water.</p><h5>Sweeping Cinder Strike</h5><p class='pad-left'>With a wide sweeping gesture, you summon forth a barrage of hot cinders. You can spend 1 ki point to cast burning hands.</p><h5>Water Whip</h5><p class='pad-left'>You summon a long, rubbery whip of pure water that you grip by one end. You can spend 1 ki point as a bonus action to create a whip of water that shoves and pulls a creature to unbalance it. A creature that you can see that is within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw.
