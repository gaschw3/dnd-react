Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</li><li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.

Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li></ul>"

You and your allies who are in the aura when the spirit appears each gain temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.</li><li><strong>Hawk:</strong> The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, marking your enemies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit's aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll.</li><li><strong>Unicorn:</strong> The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit's aura. In addition, if you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores hit points to anyone inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.</li></ul>"

Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach.

The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC.

This effect ends early if the chosen ally deals any damage to the target.</p><p class='pad-left'>The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p><h5>Bursting Arrow</h5><p class='pad-left'>You imbue your arrow with a blast of force energy drawn from the school of evocation.

When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.</p><p class='pad-left'>The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p><h5>Shadow Arrow</h5><p class='pad-left'>You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe's vision with grasping shadows. If the arrow hits a creature, the target takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.</p><p class='pad-left'>The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class..</p></div></div>"
